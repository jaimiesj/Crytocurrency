# Crytocurrency

I generated as much code as I could, including the code I would use, despite not being able to run it due to an error. The crypto_df generated 532 rows, but after scaling it, I presume, the rows doubled and I wasn't able to determine how to resolve that so when I tried to incorporate the class into the clustered_df, the index for the predictions vs the clustered_df didn't match.
