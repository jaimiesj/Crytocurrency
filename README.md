# Crytocurrency

I generated as much code as I could but ran into an issue where, despite the crypto_df generating 532 rows, after scaling it, I presume, the rows doubled and I wasn't able to determine how to resolve that so when I tried to incorporate the class into the clustered_df, the index for the predictions vs the clustered_df didn't match.
